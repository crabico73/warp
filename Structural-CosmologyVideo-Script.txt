What you’re seeing isn’t a thing being born… it’s energy hesitating, long enough to cast a shadow in the field. Out here, there are no particles. No objects. Only fields—endless, rippling with potential. But sometimes, in just the right place, the field trembles. That tremble grows—like a held breath. And then… the wave collapses. Not into a thing, but into a shadow of what could be. Energy folds inward, gains weight—mass. Matter is born. And just like that, what could be, becomes what is. Not because it had to. But because it hesitated… and that was enough.
