The Galaxy Rotation Problem:
Stars at galaxy edges move "too fast" - they should fly apart without dark matter holding them together.

But what if we're just seeing time dilation effects?

Picture a galaxy:

- Center: Supermassive black hole creates extreme gravitational field
- Edges: Minimal gravitational field, nearly empty space

From our perspective:

- Center appears to move slower (time dilation from massive black hole)
- Edges appear to move faster (time flows normally in weak gravity)

We're not seeing "missing mass." We're seeing the galaxy through different gravitational time zones.

And as human beings, we just have no concept of a scale that large. A galaxy can span 100,000 light years - time dilation could have massive, compounding effects across that distance.
