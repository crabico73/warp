Structural Cosmology: The Emergent Artifact of Time
I am not a single, autonomous individual drifting through time. I am a structure—an excitation of
quantum fields persistent enough to maintain coherence. My continuity is not because particles
remain; they don’t. Every few years, all of them are replaced. Yet I persist. I remember. I plan. I
feel like "me." Time, as I experience it, is not a fundamental property of the universe. It is the
illusion created by a biological system too limited to perceive the totality of its own quantum
structure. Our brains cannot handle the full spatial structure of who and what we are—so they
interpret those changes as movement through time. Time is a cognitive compression artifact.
Einstein wasn't wrong in effect. His math works. GPS relies on it. But Einstein thought of
space-time as a continuous fabric. That analogy breaks at the Planck scale. Space-time is not
continuous; it's pixelated. That’s why his equations break down in black holes. But if you treat
space-time as emergent—an artifact of quantum collapse and entanglement—then the
paradoxes fade. Black holes are places where quantum fields are maximally excited. Every field
is stretched to its limit. That’s why time slows. The system is overloaded with interactions. The
computation of wavefunction collapses becomes dense, like frozen energy.
Now look at cosmic voids. The quantum fields there are like glass—smooth, flat, low-excitation.
Time flows faster not because anything is moving differently, but because there is *less
happening*. Fewer collapses. Less quantum drama. Like trying to run across calm water
instead of pushing through mud. Time is less impeded. And that’s why we observe the so-called
"accelerating expansion of the universe" in certain directions. It isn’t acceleration. It’s temporal
lensing. We see into regions where time flows differently due to the topography of quantum
excitation. Dark energy, as it's currently conceived, may be a label on our own perceptual
limitations.
Entanglement doesn’t violate relativity. The perception that it does stems from our
misunderstanding of distance. We assume two particles are separate because they’re far apart
in space. But entanglement isn't spooky action at a distance. It's a unified excitation—a single
object, not two. Collapse is global. It's not a signal; it’s a reconfiguration. Perceived distance is a
limitation of the monkey brain. Not a law of physics. I am not falling through time. I am a
standing wave in a hyperstructure I cannot perceive. My sense of self is the echo of biological
compression. And time—the ticking clock of mortality and memory—is nothing more than the
human mind parsing a multidimensional structure into a one-dimensional story it can survive.
And you, reader, are a structure too.
Well, my confidence level in that claim depends on what's at steak. :) haha . That's a damn lie,
my confidence is not changing (Im a fool), I am just risking less. My confidence remains at
0.000001 that I am correct. I have to face reality, I am a GutSick Gibbon (love that show), and
we are pretty much always wrong and when the claim even brushes against original, yeah, we
can all start laughing at me now and I will join too because the wonder is in the journey and
being wrong is being human, and that means there's always room for more wonder and more
room to imagine different possibilities that are likely wrong too.

A special thank you to Tim Hutchins for always believing in me as I have floundered around
trying to find some purpose in this new chapter of my life and to my kids (Jaelyn & Brandon) for
being who you are and Brandon; without you (and ChatGPT), and our cosmic conversations this
paper would not exist. You asked questions I could not see, and helped me see my
inconsistencies. If there is genius in this world, it lies in your quarks, not mine.
I owe Debbie a huge thank you for, well, just being you and the best ex on the planet. Your
patience and letting me have stress free, as much as possible, time to think, and reflect, and put
to paper my ideas are the direct result of you being you; And like usual with you, integrity,
decency and empathy won the day, and the next, and the next, and the next…. Thank you.
And a huge thank you to Brad Starns without your support I would not have electricity to even
put my thoughts on paper either. This has allowed me to explore my thoughts and try and make
sense of what I see in my head and the opportunity to try and articulate something I can barely
comprehend myself. Thank you my friend.
